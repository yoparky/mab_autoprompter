The correct logic involves identifying the debut film, \""The Lego Batman Movie,\"" and noting its producers.\n\n**Analysis of the LLM's Performance:**  \nThe LLM's failure to provide an answer may have resulted from the specific instruction to output an empty string if the answer cannot be determined from the provided context. The context included the necessary information to identify Chris McKay's debut film but did not explicitly list the producers, potentially causing the LLM to conclude that it couldn't answer based solely on the given text.\n\n**Improvement Suggestions for the Prompt:**  \nTo improve the LLM's ability to respond accurately, the prompt can be adjusted to encourage the use of inferred information when direct answers are not available. For instance, the prompt could state: \""Use the context provided to answer the question.

Identify movies with Rich Lee's involvement in 3-D previsualizations: \""Pirates of the Caribbean\"" films, \""I Am Legend\"", \""Minority Report\"", and \""Constantine\"".\n2. Identify movies directed by Francis Lawrence: \""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay \u2013 Part 2\"", \""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay \u2013 Part 1\"", \""Red Sparrow\"", \""Touch\"" (Pilot), and \""Constantine\"".\n3. Find the intersection of the two lists: \""Constantine\"".\n\n**Analysis of Discrepancy:**\nThe LLM's answer diverged from the ground truth because it incorrectly identified \""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay \u2013 Part 2\"" as the intersection of the two lists rather than \""Constantine\"". This error likely stemmed from a misinterpretation or oversight in the logical comparison between the two lists provided in the context.\n\n**Improvement to Prompt Instructions:**\nTo help the LLM arrive at the correct answer, the prompt could benefit from more explicit guidance on how to perform the intersection of the two lists.
